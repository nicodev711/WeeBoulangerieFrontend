                    We are a true local artisan bakery established in 2012 on Clerk St, Edinburgh. We have 3 passionate,
                    skilled bakers who make all our production daily at the back of the shop. We make bread slowly,
                    gently, and with traditional methods from France, Scotland, Germany, Scandinavia, Italy, and beyond.
                    We patiently ferment doughs, sometimes over days, to bring out different flavors and marvelous
                    nutritional and conservation properties. We turn our croissants and shape our cinnamon buns. We
                    roast our vegetables and make our own tomato sauce to put in our Fougasses and Pizzettas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Really, all you see in the shop is made here, from scratch, using simple and natural ingredients. We
                    work with the weather and the seasons…and we just love it, and love to share with you the taste of
                    real bread!

                        Bread making begins with the meticulous selection of ingredients: Flour, water, salt, and
                        ferment (sourdough or very small quantities of baker’s yeast). We pride ourselves on using only
                        the finest ingredients. Our flours contain no additives or improvers, ensuring a pure and
                        authentic taste. Our high extraction (“wholemeal”) flours are organic, and our whole wheat is
                        stoneground, enriching our bread with essential nutrients.

                            Preservation</strong><br/>
                        Once the ingredients are assembled, we delicately mix them into the dough. We handle this
                        process with care, as it preserves the rich taste of our bread, albeit to the detriment of
                        volume in our loaves.

                            Flavor</strong><br/>
                        The dough then undergoes a patient fermentation process. We employ various fermentation
                        techniques to develop a myriad of tastes and textures. Our commitment to long-fermented bread
                        ensures better conservation, enhanced nutrition, and easier digestion.

                            Bread</strong><br/>
                        After fermentation, it's time for the oven. Our bread is baked to perfection, resulting in a
                        beautifully caramelized crust that significantly contributes to its rich taste profile.

                        <strong className="text-yellow-600">Step 5: Resting and Evolving</strong><br/>
                        Fresh out of the oven, our bread needs time to rest and breathe. This crucial step allows it to
                        cool properly and continue evolving. While a baguette may achieve its peak crispiness shortly
                        after baking, our breads require more time to reach their optimum. Contrary to popular belief,
                        this extended evolution enhances the flavor and texture of our loaves. Our Rye bread, for
                        instance, truly comes into its own after a few days—try it on the fifth day for an exquisite
                        experience!

                    It is at times difficult to distinguish marketing spin from what is really on offer when it
                    comes to bread. A lot of additives and processing aids need not be mentioned on labels.
                    There is
                    no legal definition of “artisan”, “sourdough” and many other terms. There is not restriction
                    on
                    the processes used to make the bread, or their continuity.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In contrast, the Real Bread Campaign proposes a comprehensive definition of “Real Bread”,
